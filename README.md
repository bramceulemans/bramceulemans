I'm a **Software Development teacher** at a vocational school, born in :netherlands: **The Netherlands**. I have professional experience in **PHP** and **Java**, a full overview of my skillset can be found below. In my hours outside of work, I love contributing to Open Source projects. I also play games occasionally.

Currently, I am helping to maintain **[:octocat: FakerPHP/Faker](https://github.com/FakerPHP/Faker)** in my spare time, together with some wonderful folks. I also wrote [:pencil2: domainhack.netlify.app](https://domainhack.netlify.app), a small web-app for generating [domain hacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack).
